          <h3>Programming.</h3>
          <p>I began to learn Java when I was 12 years old. In university I got in touch with Python a lot
            by programming in several research projects.
            Now I use 90% Java and 10% Python/Bash scripting in my daily work.
          I also work a lot with frontend projects where I've got a lot of experience in Vue.js and Javascript.

          <h3>Hacking.</h3>
          <p>My interest for security related topics began in university. There, I joined several hands-on workshops where I was able to gain skills
            for hacking WLAN or printers. Because I had so much fun doing that, I joined CTF platforms like tryhackme.com.
            Since then I've grown a passion for CTFs and by doing that I earned a lot of experience in security testing frameworks like Metasploit or Burp Suite.</p>

        <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
        <h3>If you love CTFs as much as I do.</h3>
        <p>If you want to talk about security related topics or web development in general, you can reach out to me!
          We can code or do some CTFs together while listening to some nice music! Also, since listening to music and collecting
          vinyls is another big hobby of mine, we can also just talk about music.
